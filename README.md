## About

Labeling bank transactions and displaying income/expenses via streamlit.

#### Scope

- Personal project, just for fun and exploring SQLAlchemy!
- Not designed for handling millions of transactions.
- Similar transactions can be labeled based on specific transaction categories.
- Each unique category entry has 3 levels of detail (category_1, category_2, category_3).
- Transactions should be displayed on a monthly basis, colored based on their assigned category.

#### Main Open Tasks:
[] Upload tab for uploading files (ingest raw transactions from files to database table).
[] Dockerize streamlit app and database.
[] Writing tests.
